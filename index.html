    </header>
    <main>
    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>The Python-based e-commerce application serves as a demonstration of a simple yet functional online shopping platform. It allows users to browse through a catalog of products, add items to their cart, and proceed with the checkout process. Additionally, it provides administrative functionalities for managing the product catalog.</p>

        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <h4>User Authentication:</h4>
            <p>Users can log in using their credentials, and the application verifies their identity before granting access.</p>
        <h4>Admin Authentication:</h4>
            <p>Administrators have special privileges to manage the product catalog. They can log in separately from regular users.</p>
        <h4>Product Catalog:</h4>
            <p>The application maintains a catalog of products, including information such as product ID, name, category, and price.</p>
        <h4>Cart Management:</h4>
            <p>Users can add items to their cart, view the contents of their cart, and remove items from their cart.</p>
        <h4>Checkout Process:</h4>
            <p>Once users are satisfied with their selection, they can proceed with the checkout process. The application calculates the total amount to pay and provides various payment options.</p>
        <h4>Admin Functionalities:</h4>
            <p>Administrators have access to additional functionalities, such as adding new products to the catalog, modifying existing products, removing products from the catalog, adding new categories, and removing categories.</p>

        <h3>Implementation:</h3>
        <h4>Authentication:</h4>
            <p>The application uses a simple username-password authentication mechanism stored in demo databases for both users and administrators. Upon successful authentication, the application generates a unique session ID for the user or admin.</p>
        <h4>Product Catalog:</h4>
            <p>A predefined catalog of products is created within the application, allowing users to browse and select items for purchase.</p>
        <h4>Cart Management:</h4>
            <p>Users can add items to their cart, view the contents of their cart, and remove items from their cart. The cart is managed using a list data structure.</p>
        <h4>Checkout Process:</h4>
            <p>Users can add items to their cart, view the contents of their cart, and remove items from their cart.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>The Python e-commerce application provides a basic yet comprehensive demonstration of an online shopping platform. It encompasses essential features such as user authentication, product browsing, cart management, checkout process, and administrative functionalities.
